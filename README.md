# Predicting Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) for Enhanced Marketing ROI

## Overview

This project aims to develop a predictive model for Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) using marketing campaign engagement data.  The analysis focuses on identifying key factors influencing CLTV and building a robust model to optimize future marketing campaign budgets and targeting strategies. This will allow for a more efficient allocation of resources and maximize return on investment (ROI) for marketing campaigns.  The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and evaluation.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* (Add any other libraries used here)


## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and install the required Python libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Script:** Execute the main script using:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Example Output

The script will print key findings from the analysis to the console, including descriptive statistics, model performance metrics (e.g., R-squared, RMSE), and feature importance.  Additionally, the project will generate several visualization files (e.g., `sales_trend.png`, `cltv_distribution.png`) which are saved in the project directory illustrating key trends and insights derived from the data.  These visualizations aid in understanding the relationship between different variables and the overall performance of the CLTV predictive model.
